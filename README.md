SSI-OpenRockoon
==========

Build Status - DEV
------------

**Modder's Notes**
---------
OpenRocket is a great piece of sim software. However, it has many limitations and approximations. For SSI's upcoming rockoon launch for a spaceshot attempt, we need more. The changes made or to be made are listed below:

* Incorporating an initial spin rate to provide stability
* Switching to the NRLMSISE-00 empirical atmosphere model
* Fix calculation of speed of sound
* Add NOAA wind data for Spaceport America

**TODO**
---------
* Incorporating a coefficient of drag for a finless rocket
* Accounting for the effect of Magnus force on a spinning rocket
* Allowing piping in of aerodynamic coefficients from CFD software
* Integrating some kind of coefficient estimator like Digital DATCOM
* Allowing the addition of conical "boattails" at any position on the rocket
* Integrating 3D GUI from Cambridge Rocketry
* Adding Monte Carlo ability


Overview
--------

OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying them.

The main features include:

* Six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation
* Automatic design optimization
* Realtime simulated altitude, velocity and acceleration display
* Staging and clustering support
* Cross-platform (Java-based)

OpenRocket needs help to become even better. Implementing features, writing documentation and creating example designs are just a few ways of helping.
